# Reverse-Hangman-Game
A game I call "Reverse Hangman" programmed in Eek!

Instead of guessing letters to find a secret word like in normal hangman, this game has you guessing words to find a secret letter!

Type a word in all lowercase, and the program will output "!" if the secret letter was in the word you typed. It will output "!" as many times as the letter appeared in the word. For example, if the secret letter was "o" the word "cool" would result in the program outputting "!!".

There's no limit to how many times you can guess, so just see how little guesses it takes for you to find the letter.
